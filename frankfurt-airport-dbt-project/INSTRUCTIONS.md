# **Data Engineer Technical Task**  
**Estimated Time: 3 Hours**  

## **Objective**  
Welcome! Your mission is to help an analyst explore data about **Frankfurt Airport (FRA)**. Youâ€™ll load, transform, and document the data, and later share your approach and results. **Challenge what you see and let us know your thoughts!** There will also be a chance to discuss your work and answer some SQL questions in a follow-up conversation.

## **Task Overview**  

### **1. Data Transformation & Preparation**  
Youâ€™ll be working with these datasets:  
- **Arrivals by Airport**: [OpenSky API](https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/rest.html#arrivals-by-airport)  
- **Airport Metadata**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ip2location/ip2location-iata-icao)  
- **Shipment Data**: (File: `DIM_MASTER.csv`, provided for you)  

Your main goal is to **load the data into a database and organize it in a way that makes it easy for an analyst to explore traffic through Frankfurt Airport**.

Tip: You donâ€™t need an OpenSky account, but having one can help with API limits. Hereâ€™s a login you can use:  
USERNAME = 'chi-bi'  
PASSWORD = 'djm!rzn9axm_hvh1QXK'

### **2. Documentation**  
Please include documentation to help the analyst understand your work. This should cover:  
- **A summary of the datasets and their structure**  
- **The steps you took to transform the data**  
- **Any challenges you encountered and how you solved them**  
- **How the final dataset can be used to answer business questions**

### **3. Presentation**  
At the end, youâ€™ll have a chance to present your work. Please be ready to talk about:  
- **How you collected, cleaned, and transformed the data, include a discussion of tools**  
- **The final data model or structure you created**  
- **How your dataset can help answer key business questions**  
- Answers to these questions:
  - What is the annual average of pieces arriving at Frankfurt Airport?
  - What is the monthly average of flights arriving at Frankfurt Airport?
  - What is the most common origin of masters arriving at Frankfurt Airport?

You may also be asked similar **SQL-based questions** in the follow-up.

## **Bonus Challenges (Optional)**

1. **Set up an automated ETL process** for data ingestion  
2. **Generate insights** (like trends, anomalies, or busiest times)  
3. **Add validation and data quality checks** for future data

## **How Youâ€™ll Be Evaluated**  
Weâ€™ll look at:  
- **How well you model and transform the data**  
- **How clear and helpful your documentation is**  
- **How you present and explain your work**  
- **Your problem-solving and SQL skills**
